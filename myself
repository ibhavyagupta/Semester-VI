I hope you are doing well. I wanted to sincerely thank you and the team for the support and understanding extended to me during my father’s illness. Unfortunately, my father passed away on 4th September 2025, and it has been an emotionally difficult time for me and my family.

As you know, my current work-from-home arrangement is valid until the end of October. I am currently in Jammu, taking care of my mother and younger sister as we cope with this loss and adjust to the new circumstances. Over the past few weeks, I have also been undergoing psychotherapy and taking prescribed medication to manage anxiety, sleeplessness, and PTSD-like symptoms following my father’s sudden passing. My doctor has advised me to continue this treatment plan for at least the next two months (tentatively).

In light of these circumstances, I would like to kindly request an extension of my remote work arrangement beyond October. Continuing to work from home would be extremely helpful for my mental and emotional recovery while allowing me to stay productive and contribute effectively to the team.

I truly value being part of NatWest and am grateful for the organization’s empathetic culture and focus on employee well-being. Please let me know if this extension is feasible and if there are any formalities I need to complete from my end.

Thank you very much for your understanding and continued support during this difficult period.
