I'm a Front-End Developer on the Prototyping Team — which basically means I help bring ideas to life before they become full-blown products.

Think of me as the person who takes scribbles, post-its, or wild ideas and turns them into real, clickable things you can actually test and play with.

💼 What I do (besides drinking way too much coffee ☕)
Turn early concepts into working prototypes using HTML, CSS, JS — fast and clean.

Work closely with designers to make sure their vision works in the browser, not just on slides.

Test interactions, layouts, and accessibility (because everyone deserves a great experience).

Spot potential issues before they become real problems.

Add just enough polish to make ideas feel real — without over-engineering.

💬 Talk to me about…
Making things accessible and user-friendly (yes, I check contrast ratios 🙈)

Why I love semantic HTML more than pizza (ok, maybe not more than pizza 🍕)

How to build things quickly without breaking everything

Collaborating with Figma, dev tools, and creative chaos

🎉 Fun Fact
I once spent hours fixing a layout bug that turned out to be caused by… a missing } in CSS.
Yes, I laughed. Yes, I cried. Yes, I celebrated like a hero.

Let me know if you want it in a one-pager, a slide deck, or adapted for LinkedIn/Slack!

Absolutely — here are a few funny fun facts you can pick from (or mix and match):

🤪 Fun Fact (Funny Edition)
I once spent 45 minutes debugging a layout issue… only to realize I was editing the wrong file.
(Pro tip: always check your tabs.)

I talk to my code like it’s a living thing — and yes, I say “please work” out loud.
(It listens… sometimes.)

My favorite IDE feature? Undo. I treat it like a time machine.

I’ve mastered the art of “temporarily fixing” things… that somehow go live forever.
(Shh, don’t tell anyone.)

I once fixed a bug by deleting a line of code and… it just worked.
I still don’t know why — and I’m afraid to ask.
